# Introducing the JavaScript Language

In this workshop we'll explore the syntax behind the JavaScript language.
We'll also see how to speak JavaScript by gaining an understanding of variables, types, objects, arrays, operators, control structures, loops, and functions, through a series of hands-on examples that put these ideas into action.
